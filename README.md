# Jira Board Width Updater (Beta)

Installing this extension fixes the issue where ones Jira board item summaries are trimmed on larger displays even though there is space.

NOTE: This is in beta, and sometimes requires a page refresh in order to work, even after the initial install.

*If Jira fixes this issue, this extension will become irrelevant and can be uninstalled.
