# Jira Board Width Updater (Beta)

Addresses the problem of Jira board item summaries being cut off on larger screens, despite the availability of extra space.

NOTE: This is in beta, and sometimes requires a page refresh in order to work, even after the initial install.

*If Jira fixes this issue, this extension will become irrelevant and can be uninstalled.
